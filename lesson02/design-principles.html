        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

            Visual hierarchy is the method of arranging graphic elements by
            order of importance. By relying on principles relating to size,
            color, contrast, white and more, you can influence how users
            interact with your designs, from images to websites. Visual
            hierarchy affects what you look at and focus on in a design, whether
            it's an image, graphic design, or web design. It's a key player in
            information architecture (i.e., how information is organized and
            displayed for easy understanding and navigation) and can greatly
            impact the user experience (UX). When thinking about visual
            hierarchy, you want to ask yourself a few questions: What do we want
            to draw attention to? What actions do we want our users to take?
            Where does the eye naturally go to, and where do they land? Asking
            these questions will help you use the principles outlined below to
            create a clear visual hierarchy.

        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>

            In design, whitespace is a term that refers to negative space.
            Although it's called white space, it's not always white. In essence,
            whitespace is just empty space, similar to the invisible air that
            surrounds us. It can take any color so long as it's devoid of any
            visual elements, like shapes, text, or images. Whitespace is
            everywhere in the design world. We see it on the web, on the pages
            of the books we read, and on food packaging labels. It's so
            ubiquitous that most of the time, we don't even notice it. But in a
            way, that's kind of the point. Unlike other visual design elements,
            whitespace is invisible. In fact, the main purpose of using white
            space in design is to separate and emphasize other design elements.
            However, in some instances, the whitespace is so dominant that you
            can't help but notice it. This can be done intentionally if
            emptiness has symbolic meaning in a design.

        <h3>Hick's Law</h3>

            Hick's Law describes how long it takes for a person to decide due to
            the choices they are presented with. According to this law, the more
            options you have, the longer it will take you to decide. Short for
            the Hickâ€“Hyman Law, this principle was named after British and
            American psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman. In their
            quest to comprehend the relationship between the number of stimuli
            and an individual's reaction to any given stimulus, they created an
            equation: RT = a + b log2 (n) Let's break this equation down: RT =
            reaction time a = the time that is not involved with decision-making
            b = an empirically derived constant based on the time it takes to
            process each option cognitively (Psst: It's approximately 0.155
            seconds for humans.) log2 = logarithm function (n) = the number of
            equally probable alternatives
